# New Script (for Ruby/Python)

[TOC]

## Introduction

These simple scripts help create executable ruby/python script, along with the supporting unit test script and Rakefile/Makefile.

The idea of this script is from book "Practical Ruby for System Administration" by Andre Ben Hamou.

## Usage

ruby:
> ruby newScript.rb <SCRIPT_NAME>

python:
> python newScript.py <PROJ_DIR>
