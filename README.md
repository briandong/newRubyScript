# New Script (for Ruby/Python)

## Introduction

The ideas of these scripts are from books:
* "Practical Ruby for System Administration" by Andre Ben Hamou
* "The Hitchhikerâ€™s Guide to Python" by Hitchhiker

## Usage

ruby:
> ruby newScript.rb <SCRIPT_NAME>

python:
> python newScript.py <PROJ_DIR>
